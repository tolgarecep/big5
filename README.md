# Predictive power of big five personality traits

## Dataset
Dataset* contains personality scores volunteered by 108,018 U.S. Facebook users recruited through an online personality questionnaire between 2007 and 2012. Participants were rewarded by the feedback on their scores and provided informed consent for their data to be recorded and used in research. Participants’ personality was measured using the 100-item International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) fvefactor model of personality questionnaire28, with a fve-point Likert-style response scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Te scales’ Cronbach’s α reliability equaled 0.84, 0.92, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.93 for openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, respectively.**

## Methods
Logistic Regression, XGBoost and k-nearest neighbors are used to predict subjects' political orientation, gender and age. While predicting political orientation, logistic regression gave similar result to the one in the paper.**
